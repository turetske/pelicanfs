    "Unclosed connection". Hooking Connection.__del__ is the only way to observe the leak
    from outside, and the count is only complete once a collection has run, so the block
    collects on the way in and on the way out.

    get finalised inside this window - the gc.collect() below reaches whatever happens to
    be garbage - and counting those would fail this test for someone else's leak.

    "finalised" is non-empty as well as that "leaked" is empty: if any of those move, the
