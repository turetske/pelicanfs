# Fixtures shared by the whole test suite. They fall into three groups:
#
#   * TLS setup (ca, httpserver_listen_address, httpserver_ssl_context,
#     httpclient_ssl_context) -- pelican only speaks https, so the test servers have to
#     serve https too. These mint a throwaway certificate authority and hand the server
#     a certificate from it.
#   * Clients that trust that authority (get_client, get_webdav_client). A test passes
#     these to PelicanFileSystem, which calls them instead of building its own.
#   * Canned WebDAV listing bodies (*_listing_response), read from test/resources.
#
# Three of these fixtures are named by pytest-httpserver rather than by us --
# httpserver_listen_address, httpserver_ssl_context and httpclient_ssl_context. The
# plugin looks them up when it builds its own `httpserver` fixture, so overriding them
# here is what makes `httpserver` an https server the test clients can talk to.

# Canned PROPFIND responses, read verbatim from test/resources. A test registers one as
# the reply to a PROPFIND so the library sees a realistic WebDAV answer without a real
# origin behind it.

#
#     /foo/bar/
#     |-- file1.txt
#     |-- file2.md

#     consumes.
#   * A single-resource response -- everything else -- answers a PROPFIND for one object
#     and names only that object. This is what an existence or type check consumes.
#
# The abbreviations are f1/f2 for folder1/folder2 and sf for subfolder1, so e.g.
# f2_file1 is the response for the single object /foo/bar/folder2/file1.md.
